      <p>In a 1955 biological experiment in the CSSR, Karel Hartl crossed a German Shepherd Dog with a Carpathian Wolf. The
        result led to the breed now known as the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog (also called the Czechoslovakian Vlcak). This unique
        pairing proved that the offspring of a wolf and a domestic dog could be reared as a domestic breed.
        <br>
        <br>
        After 10 years of experiments, breeders determined which of the wolf and dog qualities to select for. Today,
        Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs are a powerful breed with exceptional senses and incredible stamina. Some dogs have even
        completed endurance tests in which they ran 100 km in eight hours!
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1982, the Czech Republic and Slovakia selected the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog as their national breed. The United
        Kennel
        Club recognized the breed in 2006.</p>

    <p>The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog resembles the Carpathian wolf. Though strong and tall, the breed is light and agile.
    <br>
    <br>
    These dogs have a short, straight, and dense coat that varies based on the season. In the winter, the thick undercoat
    dominates and, together with the topcoat, makes the breed resistant to harsh weather conditions. Czech Wolfdogs are
    typically a yellow-grey to silver-grey color with a lighter-colored mask.
    <br>
    <br>
    Czech Wolfdogs have strong jaws, triangular, pricked ears, and amber-colored eyes that will confidently size you up.
    Their rectangular bodies are muscular, and their tails hang straight down when at rest.</p>

    <p>Czech Wolfdogs are very active, intelligent dogs known for their courage. They're extremely loyal to their families and
    make devoted companions. However, they may not a good fit for first-time pet parents because of their dominant and
    independent personalities.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Watchful, protective nature makes these pups good guard dogsâ€”and often suspicious of strangers. They can also have a
    strong prey drive and may pursue small animals. Early socialization can help your Czech Wolfdog develop into a
    well-mannered companion.</p>
